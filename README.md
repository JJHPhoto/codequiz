# Quiz
This week's homework assignment was to create a quiz with a timer that added time if the answer was correct and reduced time if the answer was wrong. We also needed to have a page that kept high scores from previous attempts at the quiz. This would be done using local storage but also need to be able to be cleared if the user wanted to. 

### 1. Process
the first thing to do was to read over the README & then mark up the gif we were given to see what elements would be on each page. This would let me be able to decide what goes onto each page. Then I could start connecting the elements with css & js.
